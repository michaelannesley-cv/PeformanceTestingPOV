# PeformanceTestingPOV

## Overview

PeformanceTestingPOV is a proof-of-concept project designed to evaluate the performance of our CSS system when interacting with the database. The project runs a set of benchmarks to measure both the frequency and CPU usage of various queries, providing valuable insights into system efficiency and potential bottlenecks.

## Features
- Benchmarking of CSS system queries against the database
- Measurement of query frequency and CPU utilization
- Easy-to-understand performance reports
- Designed for extensibility to support additional benchmarks

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the setup instructions (see below) to configure your environment.
3. Run the benchmark suite to collect performance metrics.
4. Review the generated reports to analyze query performance and resource usage.

## Setup
- Configure connection settings for your CSS system and database as needed.

## Running Benchmarks
Instructions for running the benchmarks will depend on the implementation (e.g., command-line, script, or UI). Refer to the main project files or scripts for specific commands.

## Results
After running the benchmarks, performance data—including query frequency and CPU usage—will be available in the output reports. Use these insights to optimize your CSS system and database interactions.

## Contributing
Contributions and suggestions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request with improvements or new benchmarks.
